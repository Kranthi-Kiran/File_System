# File_System
A file system is designed using C Language where the sector size is 512 Bytes. It is a CUI where we can create, open and delete a file or directory and read, write and seek from a file.
As the program executes a log file is writen as of what is being performed by the program example for any error or which statement is being execuited etc.
And also another file COMMANDS is updated with the commands that are executed. This file is used to restore the file system where we left last time.
